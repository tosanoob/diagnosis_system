J Am Acad Dermatol.\nThe user wants me to clean and structure the 6th part of a medical text, specifically focusing on dermatology.\nI need to apply the same cleaning steps as in the previous parts:\n1. Remove extra spaces, empty lines, and incorrect line breaks.\n2. Ensure consistent formatting for titles and paragraphs (though there are no titles in this part).\n3. Correct spelling and grammar errors.\n4. Preserve all important medical information.\n5. Ensure accurate use of medical terminology.\n6. Minimize markdown in the output.\nLooking at the text, it seems to be a continuation of the bibliography. I need to clean up each entry to ensure consistency in formatting, especially regarding journal names, volume, issue, and page numbers. I will also check for any obvious typos or formatting inconsistencies within each entry.100. Messiaen L, Yao S, Brems H, Callens T, et al (2009).
